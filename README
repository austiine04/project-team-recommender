Project
=======
Building a recommender system,

Problem
=======
Using an internal workforce tool to make recommendations for which people should on which software development project.

Goals
=====
1. Recommend a project team based on;
    - peoples skills
    - preferences
    - past project experiences 
    - upcoming/scheduled leave

2. Recommendations should minimize travel, as we would prefer as much as possible to have localised teams working in each city
